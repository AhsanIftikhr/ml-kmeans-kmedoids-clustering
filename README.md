# Clustering Algorithms - KMeans, KMedoids, Agglomerative Clustering

This project implements multiple unsupervised clustering algorithms on:
- A 2D synthetic dataset (provided)
- Wholesale Customers Dataset (UCI Repository)

##  Tasks Completed
- ✅ Manual implementation of **K-Means** from scratch
- ✅ Manual implementation of **K-Medoids** from scratch
- ✅ KMeans using `scikit-learn`
- ✅ Agglomerative Clustering using `sklearn` with `single`, `complete`, `average` linkage
- ✅ Visualization using PCA
- ✅ Silhouette Score evaluation
- ✅ Answers to comparison questions included

## 📊 Evaluation Metric
- **Silhouette Score** is used to compare clustering quality.
- K-Medoids is observed to be more robust to outliers.

## 📁 Files Included
- `ML_K_MEAN_K_MEDOID.ipynb`: Full notebook with code, plots, answers

## 📚 Dataset Used
- 2D Dataset: Provided by instructor (`dataset2d.txt`)
- Real-world Dataset: Wholesale customers from UCI ML Repo (ID: 292)
